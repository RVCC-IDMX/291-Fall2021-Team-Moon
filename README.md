## The Moon Phases Repo:

This is a repo where our final project is being stored. Our collective final was to create an interactive touch display that involves the different phases of the moon.
The completed project allows the perspective user whom may ber a group of youth wanting to either have a somewhat understanding of the moon and how things work and the diffent stages that are involved within the moon. An adult may touch the display same as the kid and have a better understanding of the graphics used thoughout the course of the project and have a better grasp of the information that was used alont side the pictures/sprites on screen. This project was used made for both the adults that bring their kids to the planetarium as well as the just the kids too who will touch this display and go "ooh" and " ahhh" and woahh isn't that neat and want to know even more about the phases of the moon after viewing this creation. Thoughout the begining phase and ending phases of this project we used our best judgement and used user friendly information during all phases and no joking intended however I'll just leave that therand I hope that all have an enjoyable time using this interactive display over the years. Thanks to all who made this project a success. Without each and everyone one of to our mission around the Earth üåç wouldn't have been possible.
