## The Moon Phases Repo:

This is a repo where our final project is being stored. Our collective final was to create an interactive touch display that involves the different phases of the moon.
The completed project allows the perspective user whom may be a group of youth wanting to either have a better understanding of how the moon moon rotates around the Earth üåç and the diffent stages that are involved within the moon.al An adult may touch the display same as the kid and they will definitely have a better understanding of how the graphics are used thoughout the course of the project and have a better grasp of the information that was used alongside the pictures/sprites on screen too. This project was designe/crafted for both the adults that bring their kids to the planetarium as well as the just the kids too who will touch this display and go ooh,woahh, isn't that neat and they will probably want to know even more about the phases of the moon after viewing this creation put together this semester. Thoughout all parts of this project contains useful information about the different phases of moon all written in our own words and used our best judgement to where the text and texts should be placed on screen and screens. Note that the information on all screens is all user friendly and is easy to read no matter your age. I hope that all have an enjoyable time using this interactive display over the years. Thanks to all who made this project a success. Without each and everyone one of you our or your mission around the Earth üåç wouldn't have been possible. Thanks it's been a true joy!
