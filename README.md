## The Moon Phases Repo:

This is a repo where our final project is being stored. Our collective final was to create an interactive touch display that involves the different phases of the moon.
The completed project allows the perspective user whom may be the following: young school kid wanting to either have a somewhat understanding of the moon and how things work and the diffent stages that are involved or an adult may touch the display and have a better understanding of the graphics. This project was used made for both groups in mind. All use friendly information and I hope that all have an enjoyable time using this interactive display over the years. Thanks to all who made this project a success.
